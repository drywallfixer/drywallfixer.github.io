        <p style="font-family: Arial;">I, if I try hard enough, can just barely remember something that should not have ever  been.. My first day of existence. Queue the old time funeral parlor music on the phonograph. The record skips as an organ plays a warbled tune forgotten by contemporary  time. I've readied myself, and with the greatest of abandon, will attempt to commit literary suicide. Ink splatters the paper violently. A signature completes the document which is savagely scrawled at the bottom of the writing in pink crayon. The contents of this literature is misspelled and mostly written backwards. What tragic thing happened to the mind that wrote this book? What sort of misdeed took place whilst this mind was forming? They say horrible things used to happen back in the 80's without all of the government oversight.</p>

<p>Saturday erases Fridays mistakes. Time goes by and all is forgotten. An amnesiac life preserves only the most vital memories. Those haunting details that refuse to let go. The very memories that drive us to become ghosts after the passing of this physical realm. Unable to let go of our collective end. Remember how full of life and hope and promise we were whence breathing the refreshing clean air? Now we are all but air, sometime a whisp of mist, or a darkened shadow. Some of us aren't seen at all we just throw shit around and make a ruckus. </p>
 
 <div id="spanks the clown">
    <h5>Spanks the Clown</h5>
<p>A very sad feller twas Spanks.  A clown incapable of pretending to be silly. Very serious and stern was his demeanor. His act consisted of him sitting at a desk  pretending to fill out paper work. Spanks tried in earnest to portray an accountant. The only problem was that Spanks did not know how to count all that well and he was always nervous that the audience might eventually figure out his deception. </p>

   <div id="liver  worst">
     <h5> Liver  Worst</h5>
<p>Some foods were never meant to be consumed. Liverworst may be one of them. Add a glass of flouridated water to the list and you have a combo meal that should have a skull and crossbones adorning the packaging it comes in.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="struggle">
      <h5>Struggle</h5>
<p>Do words like inadaquate, derelict, and incapable describe who you are with razor sharp perfection? If so, welcome to the club. Here at "Diametrically Opposed" we pride ourselves in the imperfections that make it borderline impossible for those who are like us to even exist in this world of functionality.</p>

<footer>Thanks for visiting my website. I made it with some sticks and rocks and a patch of grass. It's become a monster really. It even moves of its own volition. It really should be put gently to rest.
